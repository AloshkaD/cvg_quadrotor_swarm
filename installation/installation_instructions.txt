EXTERNAL LIBRARIES THAT SHOULD BE INSTALLED
#ncurses
sudo apt-get install libncurses5
sudo apt-get install ncurses-bin
sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev
#expect
sudo apt-get install expect



DEINSTALL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES OF OTHER (OLDER) VERSIONS OF THE STACK
sed -i '/DRONE_WORKSPACE/d' ~/.bashrc
sed -i '/DRONE_STACK/d' ~/.bashrc




NAVIGATE TO WORKSPACE OF ROS (OR CREATE IT)
#example
cd ~/workspace/ros

CREATE A FOLDER FOR THE WHOLE STACK APPLICATION
mkdir quadrotor_stack_catkin
cd quadrotor_stack_catkin

CREATION OF THE CATKING WORKSPACE and first built
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
mkdir src
cd src
catkin_init_workspace
cd ..
catkin_make


SOURCERING THE STACK
source devel/setup.bash


DOWNLOAD STACK
#choose branch. By default master!
git clone -b master https://github.com/Vision4UAV/cvg_quadrotor_swarm.git ./src/quadrotor_stack



INSTALL THE WORKSPACE -> for the setup.sh
./src/quadrotor_stack/installation/installers/installWS.sh



INSTALL THE STACK -> for the launchers and the logs
cd src/quadrotor_stack
./installation/installers/installStack.sh


#close terminal and reopen it




DOWNLOAD REQUIRED PACKAGES OF THE STACK -> This step is slow, so, be patient!
cd $DRONE_STACK
#set to true packages required in installation/configSubmodules.cfg. Be careful, some packages are private and you could not use them!
#if the packages are not already defined in the stack run script to add submodules
./installation/addSubmodules.sh installation/configSubmodules.cfg
#if the packages are already defined in the stack run script to init submodules
./installation/initSubmodules.sh installation/configSubmodules.cfg





COMPILE STACK
cd $DRONE_STACK
source setup.sh
cd $DRONE_WORKSPACE
catkin_make




OPENING STACK with qtcreator
cd $DRONE_WORKSPACE/src
rm CMakeLists.txt
cp /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake CMakeLists.txt
cd ..
source devel/setup.bash
qtcreator
#put the build folder in the correct path!
